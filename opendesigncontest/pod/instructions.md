## Intro: pod
pod is a seat made up of modules to be assembled according to your needs. Made in digital cutting, its design is based on a width of feet equivalent to the thickness of the board to give the illusion of a product
created not in plan but directly in volume.

## Step 1: cutting
Cut the pieces you need from a 19mm board with a Ã˜1mm straight cutter.

## Step 2: assembly
Drill and assemble the pieces with wood screws (35X2.5mm).
