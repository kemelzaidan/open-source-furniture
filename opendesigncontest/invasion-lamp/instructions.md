## Intro: Invasion Lamp

Design and production of a hanging lamp from a laser cutting tool and a material: 1.2mm thick cardboard sheets.

We chose not to create the shape directly from the cutout, but rather to create a kind of matrix which we then use to create a modular structure that can be declined in abajour, bedside lamp, ceiling lamp .... This matrix is composed of a simple and regular geometric element. A single element that repeats indefinitely, runs along the wire and the bulb. Thus the lamp takes shape like a growing parasite, seeking to increase, to spread, to develop. This lamp can be in perpetual evolution.

_Project carried out as part of a workshop between ESADSE and Boulle school under the direction of François Brument with Julie Brugier, Clément Ribé and Léo Virieu._

The rest of the assembly instructions were lost and in this project, they were very important.
