## Intro:

Have you ever felt that lazy, that when sitting on a couch you did not want to get up or bend over to get your glass or remote from the coffee table? I have! More than once!

When sitting on my couch I'm most comfortable with all my stuff around: laptop, coffee, newspaper and if I would have been a smoker also my cigarettes and ashtray. So I started looking for couch tables but found nothing good enough for our interiour, budget or size of the couch.

As a hobbyist designer I started designing something myself. It soon turned out that I was not sure about all the measurements and form, and to increase the number of potential clients with different couche sizes I needed to parameterize a few aspects (height and depth of the couch for example) . In combination with the need of precise location of some of the cuts, my favorite drawing programs inkscape and viacad were suddenly completely out of scope.

At that point the idea of iScriptDesign was born. It allows me to design my creation like I make a webpage, and I can adapt the drawing to fit over virtually every other couch as well. The result is a very useful small table allowing me to keep everything within my reach.
