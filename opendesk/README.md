OpenDesk.cc Design Files
===

##### 2017-11-29

[OpenDesk.cc](https://www.opendesk.cc) provides "open source"
furniture.

From their [FAQ](https://www.opendesk.cc/faq), they say:

> It’s also possible to download the manufacturing blueprints for many designs on Opendesk.
> This is because we want to empower hobby makers to build our designs in their garage workshop
> or local makerspace.
> This is where the ‘open source’ component comes in.

They use the term "open source" incorrectly and provide design files that are a mix
of open source licensed files along with other design files that are under a restrictive
license.

OpenDesk.cc has also started restricting access to their design files so that they
are only given out by request.

I have collected a list of their designs here, with notes indicating whether they
fall under a free/libre license.
A local copy of the free/libre design files are provided  for convenience here.
